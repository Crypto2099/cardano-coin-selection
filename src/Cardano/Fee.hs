-- | Given the coin selection result from a policy run, adjust the outputs for

--
-- We lose the relationship between the transaction outputs and their
-- corresponding inputs/change outputs here. This is a decision we may wish to
-- revisit later. For now however note that since
--
--  (a) coin selection tries to establish a particular ratio between
--      payment outputs and change outputs (currently it aims for an average of
--      1:1)
--
--  (b) coin selection currently only generates a single change output per
--      payment output, distributing the fee proportionally across all change
--      outputs is roughly equivalent to distributing it proportionally over
--      the payment outputs (roughly, not exactly, because the 1:1 proportion
--      is best effort only, and may in some cases be wildly different).
--
-- Note that for (a) we don't need the ratio to be 1:1, the above reasoning
-- will remain true for any proportion 1:n. For (b) however, if coin selection
-- starts creating multiple outputs, and this number may vary, then losing the
-- connection between outputs and change outputs will mean that that some
-- outputs may pay a larger percentage of the fee (depending on how many change
-- outputs the algorithm happened to choose).
